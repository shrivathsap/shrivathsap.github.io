		<p>Welcome to my website!</p>

		<p>I am Shrivathsa Pandelu, currently an MMath second year student at ISI Kolkata. Before that I got my Bmath degree from ISI Bangalore. As far as interests go, I am interested in algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, differential topology, algebraic number theory, cryptography, physics, reading etc. Here's my <a href="/cv.html">CV</a>.</p>

		<p>This site is hosted by GitHub, and was created using Jekyll. It currently uses a modified Jekyll Minima theme. The purpose of this site is to host some of the things I have written and perhaps the occasional maths related post or something like that.</p>

		<h3> Now </h3>

		<p>I am taking the following courses at ISI, Kolkata: Fourier Analysis, Number Theory, Differential Topology and Commutative Algebra. I am also doing a project under [Prof. Mahuya Dutta](https://www.isical.ac.in/~mahuya/) related to Morse Theory. Also looking at Algebraic Topology and Riemannian Geometry.</p>
