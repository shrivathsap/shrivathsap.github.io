							December is a snowy month in the Northern hemisphere (in countries where it snows; elsewhere it's just cold) and also happens to be the month I was born on. To the left is a GIF of the iterations of what's called a Koch curve or Koch snowflake. The actual Koch snowflake is the "limit" of these iterations. This is an example of a fractal or a self similar image in the sense that if you zoom into any small part, it looks like the bigger part. What's interesting about the Koch snowflake is that it bounds a finite area, but has infinite perimeter. The GIF is borrowed from Wikimedia Commons.

							The front page of The Guardian from October 28 2022. "On the day that Shell reports another round of bumper profits, and UK temperatures hit 20C in October, the UN finds there is 'no credible way' to keep to the 1.5C climate target". Towards the bottom right it says that the Meta (parent company of Facebook) shares lost 25% value and the bottom row is about an interview with actor Bill Nighy and a ranking of Jennifer Lawrence's films.
