Chitin is the second most abundant polysaccharide (first being cellulose) and is used in a modified form by most arthropods.
							</br>
							When modified chitin gives a strong shell to most insects.

							It turns out that blue is a very rare pigment in nature and most of the blue we see (in flowers, insects, birds etc.) is often the result of the physics of light! Usually colours work by complementary absorption.

						An Indian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peafowl">peacock</a> shows off its brilliant plumage. To quote Darwin, the peacock might be "the most splendid of living birds" and I think we can all agree on that. There are two hypothesis on the evolution of these feathers: one is simply an attraction to the colours, another is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicap_principle">handicap principle</a> which says that brighter, larger secondary characteristics, such as these feathers, indicate a fitter individual because non-fit ones couldn't afford them.

						The colours are not mainly due to pigments but due to optical effects from the nanostructures in the feather (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescence">iridescence</a>) and is a fascinating subject on its own.

						Here's a new word: peacocks are <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galliformes>Gallinaceous birds</a>. There is another species in the same genus - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_peafowl">Green peafowl</a>, native to the tropical forests of Southeast Asia.

						This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_tapir">mountain tapir</a> (pronounced tay-per). There are 4 recognized species of tapirs and this one is found only in a small region of the Andes. It is the smallest tapir species, has a thick wooly coat and white lips (and this is the first time I've ever thought about the lip colours of animals).

						A distinctive feature of tapirs is their nose-trunk. It is flexible, can move in all directions and is made up entirely of soft tissue. I thought they might be related to elephants, but turns out they are more related to rhinos and horses than elephants.

						The mountain tapir roams between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_forest">cloud forests</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A1ramo">paramos</a> between seasons. With the loss of habitat, among other threats, they are now an endangered species (but sadly, their population may have already fallen below the level needed to sustain genetic diversity).

							This is a picture of an elephant, specifically, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_bush_elephant">African bush elephant</a>. But what I really want to highlight is the elephant trunk. It is pure muscle, very little fat and no bones. There are more muscles in the elephant trunk than there are in the human body! It can lift up to 350kgs but can also crack a peanut shell without breaking the peanut. Using their trunk, elephants can reach for things up to 7m high and dig the ground!</br>
							
							It is awesome as a nose too - able to siphon water, useable as a snorkel when swimming and has an amazing sense of smell. An evolutionary marvel! Other things about the elephant that amuse me are their tusks, ears, ability to sense vibrations through their feet, their sheer size. What amazing creatures!

							This is a picture of Saturn's moon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daphnis_(moon)">Daphnis</a>. It's about 8km in diameter and resides in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn#Keeler_Gap">Keeler gap</a>, a 42km wide gap in Saturn's A-ring. This moon was discovered in 2005, but it was inferred to exist before that because of its gravitational effects on the rings. As visible in this picture, as the moon orbits Saturn it pulls and tugs on the rings and this causes these ripples on the edges of the Keeler gap. Why ripples? Because the inner ring moves slightly faster than the moon and the outer one slightly slower - so the inner ripple moves ahead of the moon and the outer one lags behind. This is such a beautiful phenomenon in our solar system!

Stoat's belong to the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustelidae">family</a> as otters and weasels and such. Stoats are distributed across the Northern hemisphere and this white fur is seen in those subspecies that live further up North. There are 21 subspecies and they moult twice a year (the moulting process initiated by change in day length) and some of them go completely white (except for the ends of their tails) during the winter.
	
							These creatures are carnivorous and when introduced in New Zealand to control rabbits, they quickly became one of the "top 100" worse invasive species! Interestingly, the stoat doesn't dig its own burrow, but uses the burrows of its prey. Sadly, their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ermine_(heraldry)">white fur</a> used to be seen as a status of royalty.

							</br>
							TThere are two species in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudyptula">Eudyptula ("good little diver")</a> genus. This species was (after initially being classfied as a species in 1826) reclassified as a subspecies of the other little penguin, but in 2016 (that's so recent!) was reclassified as its own species. Both species are found in Southern Australia and regions of New Zealand.
							</br>
							The penguins in this genus are the smallest of all penguins growing to be around 33 cm and weighing just 1.5kgs! They have a lifespan of about 6.5 years.
							</br>
							Among other differences, the species pictured has a more distinct blue colour compared to the other, and this is due to an abundance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanosome">melanosomes</a>. How might such a beautiful blue penguin sound? Listen to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:20091121_Little_Penguin_calls_at_St_Kilda_Breakwater.ogg">this audio clip</a> on the linked Wikipedia page.

This nebula formed when a star exploded and lit the skies for 2 years between 1054 and 1056. When a star's core is not supported against gravity pulling it inwards, it collapses at about 23% the speed of light. In other words, if you were standing there, the ground would disappear at a significant fraction of the speed of light! What follows is a lot of nuclear and astrophysics that I don't understand, leading to the creation of heavier elements (which is the only way things like iron even come into existence) and depending on the mass of the collapsing star, we may get a neutron star, a black hole, or some other exotic cosmic object.

							I was curious about what gave berries and grapes their colour. Pictured is the base unit of anthocyanidines. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthocyanin">Anthocyanins</a> are glycosides of this unit. What that means is that you take this molecule, replace most of the Rs with "-OH, -OCH3" molecules, but one of them (usually the third one) with a sugar molecule. Anthocyanins go from red in low pH conditions to blue in high pH.</br>
	
							It is these pigments that give the beautiful red, black, purple colours to berries, cherries, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_corn">purple corn</a> and more. There is another class of pigments called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betalain">betalains</a> that give the colour to beets and cacti.

Now cycads are not coniferous, although they do reproduce using cones. This species is found <i>only</i> in Tanzania, and grows to about 1m high. The pictured cone is about 45cm long. The sad part is that there are only 50 mature plants left. Cycads are very old and have been around for more than 65 million years, but are now in decline (I found <a href='https://youtu.be/ugNoh-_0R7E?si=woE7ks660KLNQ7Mu'>this video</a> informative).

Sometimes they attack live animals and seem to favour tortoises. Can you guess how they break a tortoise's shell? I can only wonder why it evolved this way.

							Time flies, huh. Well, February is the shortest month, even with a leap day. Did you know that you can know the age of some trees by counting the tree rings (you don't have to cut the tree, you can drill out a sample)? It's because as the tree grows, the type of bark it makes changes depending on the seasons. So you get an alternating pattern and counting those gives you how many years have passed. Of course, it's also because there's only one of each season every year (or is it the other way round?). It's not accurate, of course, because the same season can have different severity over the years. What you're actually looking at is the climate history that the tree has lived through! This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrochronology">dendrochronology</a>.

							This is a picture of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labord's_chameleon">Labord's chameleon</a>. Amazingly, in certain arid regions of their habitat, these species have a lifespan of about 4-5 months: the eggs hatch during the wet season in November, they reach adulthood by January, then they deposit their eggs between late January and late March after which the entire species dies. Poof, just like that, and the cycle continues.
							</br>
							That's just evolution and this strategy seems to have worked for this species at this point in history.

							I was reading about apples from Michael Pollan's book "The Botany of Desire". On the left are some blossoms on an apple tree. What's really interesting about apples is that a plant grown from the seeds doesn't usually have the same characteristics as the parents. This results in apples having a large amount of variation, which is useful for the apple to survive in a wide variety of habitats. Today cultivators use methods like grafting to retain the features that we all love, with an unintended consequence being that the (domestic) apple has "stopped" evolving.<br />

							I'm back home and monsoon is right around the corner. Petrichor (from Greek) is the word for the scent of rain on dry soil. It's a really nice scent.

							On the left is a groundhog preparing its nest for hibernation. The northern hemisphere is warming up and a lot of bats, groundhogs and bears would be waking up from their long winter slumber. Interestingly, ectothermic creatures like reptiles and amphibians cannot hibernate but instead show some dormancy (brumation). Some birds exihibit (involuntarily) lowered activity (torpor). It's all triggered by seasonal cues and their biology. Would they too think to themselves "just 5 more minutes"?

This (genus of) species on the left is so rare that we only have a handful of sightings and we aren't even sure about it's full size (it's tentacles are believed to grow up to 8m in length) as an adult nor do we know about its feeding habits or how it eats even! It's really fascinating how these creatures have evolved at such depths and darkness and how little we know about them. In a way, the depths of the ocean is an alien world compared to the surface.

It's lifespan has three stages, the larval nymph stage lasting about 1 year to several years depending on the species, the intermediate subimago stage that lasts a few minutes to a couple of days and the imago or adult stage where they are mature and can fly, but the primary purpose is reproduction. The adult stage is very short (typically less than a day) and the adult females of <i>Dolania americana</i> lives for less than 5 minutes. It is strange and fascinating how this species has survived for as long as it has.
