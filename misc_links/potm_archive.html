							Time flies, huh. Well, February is the shortest month, even with a leap day. Did you know that you can know the age of some trees by counting the tree rings (you don't have to cut the tree, you can drill out a sample)? It's because as the tree grows, the type of bark it makes changes depending on the seasons. So you get an alternating pattern and counting those gives you how many years have passed. Of course, it's also because there's only one of each season every year (or is it the other way round?). It's not accurate, of course, because the same season can have different severity over the years. What you're actually looking at is the climate history that the tree has lived through! This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrochronology">dendrochronology</a>.

							This is a picture of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labord's_chameleon">Labord's chameleon</a>. Amazingly, in certain arid regions of their habitat, these species have a lifespan of about 4-5 months: the eggs hatch during the wet season in November, they reach adulthood by January, then they deposit their eggs between late January and late March after which the entire species dies. Poof, just like that, and the cycle continues.
							</br>
							That's just evolution and this strategy seems to have worked for this species at this point in history.

							This is a picture of a dragonfly eye! Definitely one of my top favourite insects. Did you know that dragonfly eyes have nearly 24000 "units" to sense light? It is believed that dragonflies see in slow motion because they see images at a much <a href="https://www.bbc.com/reel/video/p035dt53/dragonflies-see-the-world-in-slow-motion">faster rate</a> than humans do. They can see in all directions at once and nearly 80% of their brain is dedicated to sight.</br>
							These fascinating creatures are fast fliers and can propel themselves in all six directions! Blue skies and dragonflies: a merry treat for my eyes!</br>

Much has happened and this is a reminder that time's precious. To sieze the day while we are still able to is the hope that drives us. Some days we are able to sieze while others slip through the fingers like dry sand on a deserted beach; deserted yet, like our lives, the susurration of waves is incessant - back and forth, giving and taking from the shore. So it goes.<br />

							I was reading about apples from Michael Pollan's book "The Botany of Desire". On the left are some blossoms on an apple tree. What's really interesting about apples is that a plant grown from the seeds doesn't usually have the same characteristics as the parents. This results in apples having a large amount of variation, which is useful for the apple to survive in a wide variety of habitats. Today cultivators use methods like grafting to retain the features that we all love, with an unintended consequence being that the (domestic) apple has "stopped" evolving.<br />

							This is the thumbnail on Youtube for one of my favourite pieces of music: <a href="https://youtu.be/M0MrgXqat5k">primeiro verão</a> by Lilian Pinto. It means "first summer" in Portuguese and this has been a summer of many firsts for me and perhaps the world too. I got diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and it has been quite a horrible shock. This has also been my first summer as a proper adult with a job and responsibilities. This July there were so many many climate records broken that we're in for some drastic climate disasters that we have absolutely no control over. This was also a first monsoon with far fewer rains than I remember.

							Unfortunately, the rainy season hasn't been that rainy. A sign of times to come? On the left is pistachio fruits. The nut is dried before consumption and I was thinking about how we eat the seed itself, and not the fruit like in other fruits. That made me realize that I have never seen pistachio fruits. This is what they look like. It grows in arid regions and can live up to 300 years!

							I'm back home and monsoon is right around the corner. Petrichor (from Greek) is the word for the scent of rain on dry soil. It's a really nice scent. It is produced when rain causes the release of certain aerosols that carry the chemical geosmin which is responsible for the scent. It is believed that camels rely on petrichor to locate oases!

							On the left is a groundhog preparing its nest for hibernation. The northern hemisphere is warming up and a lot of bats, groundhogs and bears would be waking up from their long winter slumber. Interestingly, ectothermic creatures like reptiles and amphibians cannot hibernate but instead show some dormancy (brumation). Some birds exihibit (involuntarily) lowered activity (torpor). It's all triggered by seasonal cues and their biology. Would they too think to themselves "just 5 more minutes"?

							On the left is an illustration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleen"> baleen</a> hair. The baleen plate is a clever mechanism that enables whales to take in a lot of water and filter it out through this comb-like structure leaving behind small creatures like krill (which the whales eat). I think it's pretty cool. There's an animation in the movie "Finding Nemo" by Pixar Studios. There's this song called "Baleen Morning" by Balmorhea that led me to look up the word.

							This month I'd like to bring attention to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigfin_squid">Bigfin squid</a> and more generally, deep sea creatures. This (genus of) species on the left is so rare that we only have a handful of sightings and we aren't even sure about it's full size (it's tentacles are believed to grow up to 8m in length) as an adult nor do we know about its feeding habits or how it eats even! It's really fascinating how these creatures have evolved at such depths and darkness and how little we know about them. In a way, the depths of the ocean is an alien world compared to the surface.

							<a href="./misc_links/potm_archive.html">Last month's picture</a> was that of one of the oldest living things, so this month I chose something on the other end: the mayfly. It's lifespan has three stages, the larval nymph stage lasting about 1 year to several years depending on the species, the intermediate subimago stage that lasts a few minutes to a couple of days and the imago or adult stage where they are mature and can fly, but the primary purpose is reproduction. The adult stage is very short (typically less than a day) and the adult females of <i>Dolania americana</i> lives for less than 5 minutes. It is strange and fascinating how this species has survived for as long as it has.

This is an example of a fractal or a self similar image in the sense that if you zoom into any small part, it looks like the bigger part. What's interesting about the Koch snowflake is that it bounds a finite area, but has infinite perimeter. The GIF is borrowed from Wikimedia Commons.
