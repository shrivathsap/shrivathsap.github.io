							The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot">Pale Blue Dot</a> has gone around the sun yet again since I started "Picture of the month". Much has happened and this is a reminder that time's precious. To sieze the day while we are still able to is the hope that drives us. Some days we are able to sieze while others slip through the fingers like dry sand on a deserted beach; deserted yet, like our lives, the susurration of waves is incessant - back and forth, giving and taking from the shore. So it goes.<br />
							On the left is Earth as seen from 6 billion kilometres away: it's the pale dot about half way up the rightmost band.<br />

							I was reading about apples from Michael Pollan's book "The Botany of Desire". On the left are some blossoms on an apple tree. What's really interesting about apples is that a plant grown from the seeds doesn't usually have the same characteristics as the parents. This results in apples having a large amount of variation, which is useful for the apple to survive in a wide variety of habitats. Today cultivators use methods like grafting to retain the features that we all love, with an unintended consequence being that the (domestic) apple has "stopped" evolving.<br />

							This is the thumbnail on Youtube for one of my favourite pieces of music: <a href="https://youtu.be/M0MrgXqat5k">primeiro verão</a> by Lilian Pinto. It means "first summer" in Portuguese and this has been a summer of many firsts for me and perhaps the world too. I got diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and it has been quite a horrible shock. This has also been my first summer as a proper adult with a job and responsibilities. This July there were so many many climate records broken that we're in for some drastic climate disasters that we have absolutely no control over. This was also a first monsoon with far fewer rains than I remember.

							Unfortunately, the rainy season hasn't been that rainy. A sign of times to come? On the left is pistachio fruits. The nut is dried before consumption and I was thinking about how we eat the seed itself, and not the fruit like in other fruits. That made me realize that I have never seen pistachio fruits. This is what they look like. It grows in arid regions and can live up to 300 years!

							I'm back home and monsoon is right around the corner. Petrichor (from Greek) is the word for the scent of rain on dry soil. It's a really nice scent. It is produced when rain causes the release of certain aerosols that carry the chemical geosmin which is responsible for the scent. It is believed that camels rely on petrichor to locate oases!

							On the left is a groundhog preparing its nest for hibernation. The northern hemisphere is warming up and a lot of bats, groundhogs and bears would be waking up from their long winter slumber. Interestingly, ectothermic creatures like reptiles and amphibians cannot hibernate but instead show some dormancy (brumation). Some birds exihibit (involuntarily) lowered activity (torpor). It's all triggered by seasonal cues and their biology. Would they too think to themselves "just 5 more minutes"?

							On the left is an illustration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleen"> baleen</a> hair. The baleen plate is a clever mechanism that enables whales to take in a lot of water and filter it out through this comb-like structure leaving behind small creatures like krill (which the whales eat). I think it's pretty cool. There's an animation in the movie "Finding Nemo" by Pixar Studios. There's this song called "Baleen Morning" by Balmorhea that led me to look up the word.

							This month I'd like to bring attention to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigfin_squid">Bigfin squid</a> and more generally, deep sea creatures. This (genus of) species on the left is so rare that we only have a handful of sightings and we aren't even sure about it's full size (it's tentacles are believed to grow up to 8m in length) as an adult nor do we know about its feeding habits or how it eats even! It's really fascinating how these creatures have evolved at such depths and darkness and how little we know about them. In a way, the depths of the ocean is an alien world compared to the surface.

							<a href="./misc_links/potm_archive.html">Last month's picture</a> was that of one of the oldest living things, so this month I chose something on the other end: the mayfly. It's lifespan has three stages, the larval nymph stage lasting about 1 year to several years depending on the species, the intermediate subimago stage that lasts a few minutes to a couple of days and the imago or adult stage where they are mature and can fly, but the primary purpose is reproduction. The adult stage is very short (typically less than a day) and the adult females of <i>Dolania americana</i> lives for less than 5 minutes. It is strange and fascinating how this species has survived for as long as it has.

							Another year has passed. Days (rotation of the earth), months (lunar cycles), years (seasons) are somewhat natural; hours, minutes, weeks etc. are man-made units. On the left is a picture (from Wikimedia Commons) of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methuselah_(tree)">Metuselah tree</a> which is the oldest (non-clonal) living thing (known). It has seen 5000 summers go by, many full moons and droughts and meteor showers. Fortunately, it can't think (like us), else (I imagine) it would have been unbearably boring to just stand in a Californian desert for millennia.

							December is a snowy month in the Northern hemisphere (in countries where it snows; elsewhere it's just cold) and also happens to be the month I was born on. To the left is a GIF of the iterations of what's called a Koch curve or Koch snowflake. The actual Koch snowflake is the "limit" of these iterations. This is an example of a fractal or a self similar image in the sense that if you zoom into any small part, it looks like the bigger part. What's interesting about the Koch snowflake is that it bounds a finite area, but has infinite perimeter. The GIF is borrowed from Wikimedia Commons.
