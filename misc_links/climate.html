			Climate change is an issue of growing concern and it is important that we know what is happening. Of course, it is not upon individuals to fix this problem, but an informed individual is better than an uninformed one. However, excessive consumption of related news is potentially harmful, so here's a <a href="https://source.unsplash.com/random/?cute,animal">photo</a> that might cheer you up.

				The concentration of CO2 has been on the rise and has crossed 410ppm which is alarming. This is not the only greenhouse gas, there's methane, nitrous oxide among others which have a stronger greenhouse effect.

			<p>The problem is that greenhouse gases capture heat from the sun and keep the atmosphere warm. This leads to loss of ice in the polar regions (and elsewhere; the Himalayas form the <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2887/the-water-future-of-earths-third-pole/">third pole</a>). Loss of ice means loss of reflectivity which creates a positive feedback loop leading to further ice loss.</p>
