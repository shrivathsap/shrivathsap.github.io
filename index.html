		<h3>About this site</h3>
		<p>This site is a pet project. It is hosted by GitHub, and was created using Jekyll. It currently uses a modified Jekyll Minima theme. The purpose of this site is to host some of the things I have written and perhaps the occasional maths related post or something like that.
