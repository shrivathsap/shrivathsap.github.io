						This is a picture of the greater roadrunner running. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wile_E._Coyote_and_the_Road_Runner">Looney Tunes cartoon</a> is based on this bird. Found in the arid southwestern US and Mexico, this is a small bird in the cuckoo family. They are small birds with limited flight, 4 toes 2 pointing forward, 2 backward and can run up to 32kmph. Among its predators is the coyote. However, unlike the cartoon, it's not blue in colour. That's all for this month, beep beep.</br>
