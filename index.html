		<p>Welcome to my website!</p>

						This is a screengrab of global average temperatures for the year 2022 from <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/interactives/climate-time-machine">NASA's interactive climate change time machine</a>. As per the website,"This color-coded map shows a progression of changing global surface temperatures since 1884. Dark blue indicates areas cooler than average. Dark red indicates areas warmer than average."<br>

						I don't see any blue regions. There is currently a heat wave happening in India with temperatures reaching 40°C in some regions. I am hoping it is a consequence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o%E2%80%93Southern_Oscillation">El Niño</a> rather than the grim reality of climate change that is just around the corner. This could be our new normal. In fact, it seems very unlikely that this won't be our new normal.
