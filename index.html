						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surface_temperature">This graph</a> shows the deviation of the global mean surface temperature (GMST) from the pre-industrial era. GMST is the average of surface temperatures recorded over land, sea and sea ice. We are currently about 1.2 °C above the pre-industrial average. The year 2023 was the warmest year ever recorded (although some of it can be due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o">El Niño</a>) and it is quite likely that 2024 will be too. Even though the 2015 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement">Paris Agreement</a> promised to keep warming "well under 2 °C", we are on track to reach about 2.7 °C by 2100.</br>
