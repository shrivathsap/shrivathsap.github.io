						This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_tapir">mountain tapir</a> (pronounced tay-per). There are 4 recognized species of tapirs and this one is found only in a small region of the Andes. It is the smallest tapir species, has a thick wooly coat and white lips (and this is the first time I've ever thought about the lip colours of animals).

						A distinctive feature of tapirs is their nose-trunk. It is flexible, can move in all directions and is made up entirely of soft tissue. I thought they might be related to elephants, but turns out they are more related to rhinos and horses than elephants.

						The mountain tapir roams between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_forest">cloud forests</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A1ramo">paramos</a> between seasons. With the loss of habitat, among other threats, they are now an endangered species (but sadly, their population may have already fallen below the level needed to sustain genetic diversity).
