						This is a scanning electron microscope photo of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorryia_formosa">citrus yellow mite</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mite">Mites</a> are minute creatures, most being less than 1mm in size. The yellow mite in particular is generally less than 250 micrometers in size. That's tiny! These mites are usually found in citrus plants and they have a lifespan of about 37 days. Their lifecycle has about 6 stages, and they reproduce by a strange way called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelytoky">thelytoky</a>, a form of reproduction without mating. Some mites are pests, but these aren't. I think it's amazing that such tiny creatures exist and that we can take such beautiful pictures.
