						An Indian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peafowl">peacock</a> shows off its brilliant plumage. To quote Darwin, the peacock might be "the most splendid of living birds" and I think we can all agree on that. There are two hypothesis on the evolution of these feathers: one is simply an attraction to the colours, another is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicap_principle">handicap principle</a> which says that brighter, larger secondary characteristics, such as these feathers, indicate a fitter individual because non-fit ones couldn't afford them.

						The colours are not mainly due to pigments but due to optical effects from the nanostructures in the feather (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescence">iridescence</a>) and is a fascinating subject on its own.

						Here's a new word: peacocks are <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galliformes>Gallinaceous birds</a>. There is another species in the same genus - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_peafowl">Green peafowl</a>, native to the tropical forests of Southeast Asia.
