						I was curious about what gave berries and grapes their colour. Pictured is the base unit of anthocyanidines. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthocyanin">Anthocyanins</a> are glycosides of this unit. What that means is that you take this molecule, replace most of the Rs with "-OH, -OCH3" molecules, but one of them (usually the third one) with a sugar molecule. Anthocyanins go from red in low pH conditions to blue in high pH.</br>

						It is these pigments that give the beautiful red, black, purple colours to berries, cherries, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_corn">purple corn</a> and more. There is another class of pigments called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betalain">betalains</a> that give the colour to beets and cacti. Interestingly, betalains and anthocyanins have never been found in the same plant.
