						This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pappus_(botany)">pappus</a> of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taraxacum">dandelion</a>, i.e., the white fluffy thing. It's attached to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achene">achene</a>, which is a dry fruit that <i>contains</i> the seed.</br>

						Disperesed by winds, they land wherever the wind takes them. But they are not completely "helpless"; it turns out that these structures have so evolved that they generate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_ring#Separated_vortex_rings">a vortex ring</a> that stabilizes the travel and increases lift. That's so cool!</br>

						Even though they don't have control over the winds, they seem well prepared and leave only when they are ready to.
