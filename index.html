						I was reading about apples from Michael Pollan's book "The Botany of Desire". On the left are some blossoms on an apple tree. What's really interesting about apples is that a plant grown from the seeds doesn't usually have the same characteristics as the parents. This results in apples having a large amount of variation, which is useful for the apple to survive in a wide variety of habitats. Today cultivators use methods like grafting to retain the features that we all love, with an unintended consequence being that the (domestic) apple has "stopped" evolving.<br />
