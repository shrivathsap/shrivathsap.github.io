						On the left is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey_bee">honey bee</a> foraging on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quince">quince</a> flower. When the temperature drops to about 10 °C, bees stop flying around and huddle around the queen maintaining the core temperature between 27 °C and 34 °C. During winter, they consume honey and the amount consumed depends on how long and severe the winter is. Fascinating! Note that honey bees don't hibernate, although there are solitary bees that do.
