		<p>Welcome to my website!</p>

		<p>I am Shrivathsa Pandelu. Here's my <a href="/cv.html">CV</a>. I am a first year maths PhD student at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.</p>

		<h3>Now</h3>
		Finished my preliminary exams. Taking courses on Harmonic analysis, Lie groups and Algebraic Geometry, while also reading things on my own. First Minnesotan winter.

		<h3>Picture of the month</h3>

					December is a snowy month in the Northern hemisphere (in countries where it snows; elsewhere it's just cold) and also happens to be the month I was born on. To the left is a GIF of the iterations of what's called a Koch curve or Koch snowflake. The actual Koch snowflake is the "limit" of these iterations. This is an example of a fractal or a self similar image in the sense that if you zoom into any small part, it looks like the bigger part. What's interesting about the Koch snowflake is that it bounds a finite area, but has infinite perimeter. The GIF is borrowed from Wikimedia Commons.
