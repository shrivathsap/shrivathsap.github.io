						I think blue is one of the rarer colours to appear in plant and animal life. On the left is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudyptula_novaehollandiae">Australian little penguin</a>, also called the fairy penguin or blue penguin.
						</br>
						TThere are two species in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudyptula">Eudyptula ("good little diver")</a> genus. This species was (after initially being classfied as a species in 1826) reclassified as a subspecies of the other little penguin, but in 2016 (that's so recent!) was reclassified as its own species. Both species are found in Southern Australia and regions of New Zealand.
						</br>
						The penguins in this genus are the smallest of all penguins growing to be around 33 cm and weighing just 1.5kgs! They have a lifespan of about 6.5 years.
						</br>
						Among other differences, the species pictured has a more distinct blue colour compared to the other, and this is due to an abundance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanosome">melanosomes</a>. How might such a beautiful blue penguin sound? Listen to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:20091121_Little_Penguin_calls_at_St_Kilda_Breakwater.ogg">this audio clip</a> on the linked Wikipedia page.
