						I'm back home and monsoon is right around the corner. Petrichor (from Greek) is the word for the scent of rain on dry soil. It's a really nice scent. It is produced when rain causes the release of certain aerosols that carry the chemical geosmin which is responsible for the scent. It is believed that camels rely on petrichor to locate oases!
