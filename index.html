		<p>Welcome to my website!</p>

		<p>I am Shrivathsa Pandelu. Here's my <a href="/cv.html">CV</a>. I am a first year maths PhD student at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.</p>

		<h3>Now</h3>
		Finished my preliminary exams. Taking courses on Harmonic analysis, Lie groups and Algebraic Geometry, while also reading things on my own. First Minnesotan winter.

		<h3>Picture of the month</h3>

						Another year has passed. Days (rotation of the earth), months (lunar cycles), years (seasons) are somewhat natural; hours, minutes, weeks etc. are man-made units. On the left is a picture (from Wikimedia Commons) of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methuselah_(tree)">Metuselah tree</a> which is the oldest (non-clonal) living thing (known). It has seen 5000 summers go by, many full moons and droughts and meteor showers. Fortunately, it can't think (like us), else (I imagine) it would have been unbearably boring to just stand in a Californian desert for millennia.
