						This month's picture was going to be just the top of a pine cone (<a href='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Top_of_a_pine_cone.jpg/800px-Top_of_a_pine_cone.jpg'>click here</a>). Pine cones are the seed bearing parts of coniferous trees (usually). I think they look fantastic with their precise, mathematical patterns and they are woody and sturdy unlike flowers. While searching for a suitable picture, I came across this picture. It is the cone of a plant called <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalartos_sclavoi'>Sclavo's cycad</a>. Now cycads are not coniferous, although they do reproduce using cones. This species is found <i>only</i> in Tanzania, and grows to about 1m high. The pictured cone is about 45cm long. The sad part is that there are only 50 mature plants left. Cycads are very old and have been around for more than 65 million years, but are now in decline (I found <a href='https://youtu.be/ugNoh-_0R7E?si=woE7ks660KLNQ7Mu'>this video</a> informative).
