						This is a closeup picture of the wing of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leafhopper">leaf hopper</a>. How did it get those colours? The wing is composed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitin">chitin</a>. Chitin is the second most abundant polysaccharide (first being cellulose) and is used in a modified form by most arthropods.
						</br>
						When modified chitin gives a strong shell to most insects. In butterfly wings, stacks of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroid">gyroids</a> made of chitin come together to create brilliant colours via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin-film_interference">thin film interference</a>. This is one subtype of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_coloration">structural colouration</a>, and as an example, have a look at the wings of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Butterfly_Morpho_rhetenor_helena_(M)_KL.jpg">Morpho butterfly</a>.

						It turns out that blue is a very rare pigment in nature and most of the blue we see (in flowers, insects, birds etc.) is often the result of the physics of light! Usually colours work by complementary absorption.
