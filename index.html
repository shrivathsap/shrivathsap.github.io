						This is a picture of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsier">Philippine Tarsier</a>. Tarsiers are named after their long <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarsus_(skeleton)">tarsus</a> bones, but the feature that captures our eyes are their eyes. Their eyes have an average diameter of about 16mm which is comparable to that of a new born human's eyes. Their eyes are as large as their brains, sometimes larger! They have the largest eye-to-body weight ratio of all mammals. They can also turn their heads 180° in either direction (because they cannot move their eyes).</br>

						Tarsiers are nocturnal and mainly feed on insects. They are shy, reclusive and do not do well under stress or captivity. In the wild, they can live up to 24 years! I came to know about tarsiers in a book about animals when I was much younger and have been fascinated ever since.
