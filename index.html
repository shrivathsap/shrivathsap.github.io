						This is a picture of a dragonfly eye! Definitely one of my top favourite insects. Did you know that dragonfly eyes have nearly 24000 "units" to sense light? It is believed that dragonflies see in slow motion because they see images at a much <a href="https://www.bbc.com/reel/video/p035dt53/dragonflies-see-the-world-in-slow-motion">faster rate</a> than humans do. They can see in all directions at once and nearly 80% of their brain is dedicated to sight.</br>
						These fascinating creatures are fast fliers and can propel themselves in all six directions! Blue skies and dragonflies: a merry treat for my eyes!</br>
