						On the left is a groundhog preparing its nest for hibernation. The northern hemisphere is warming up and a lot of bats, groundhogs and bears would be waking up from their long winter slumber. Interestingly, ectothermic creatures like reptiles and amphibians cannot hibernate but instead show some dormancy (brumation). Some birds exihibit (involuntarily) lowered activity (torpor). It's all triggered by seasonal cues and their biology. Would they too think to themselves "just 5 more minutes"?
