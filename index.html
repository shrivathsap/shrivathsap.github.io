		<p>Welcome to my website!</p>

		<p>I am Shrivathsa Pandelu. Here's my <a href="/cv.html">CV</a>. I am a first year maths PhD student at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.</p>

		<h3>Now</h3>
		Spring semester 2023. Taking courses on Algebraic Geometry, Lie Groups and hopefully I will also be able to read a bunch of things on the side.
		<div id="progress-bar" style="width:100%;">
			<canvas id="canvas" title="Countdown to go home"></canvas>
		</div>
		<script type="text/javascript">
				canvas = document.getElementById('canvas')
				canvas.height = 25;
				canvas.width = document.getElementById('progress-bar').clientWidth;

				function days_between(date1, date2) {
					const one_day = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24;
					return (date2 - date1) / one_day;
				}

				var c = canvas.getContext('2d');//context
				c.fillStyle = "grey";
				c.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
				start = new Date(2023, 0, 14);
				end = new Date(2023, 4, 15);
				today = new Date();
				//today.setHours(0, 0, 0);
				percentage = 1;
				if (days_between(today, end) >= 0) {
					percentage = 1 - (days_between(today, end) / days_between(start, end));
				}
				c.fillStyle = "green";
				c.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width * percentage, canvas.height);

						Another year has passed. Days (rotation of the earth), months (lunar cycles), years (seasons) are somewhat natural; hours, minutes, weeks etc. are man-made units. On the left is a picture (from Wikimedia Commons) of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methuselah_(tree)">Metuselah tree</a> which is the oldest (non-clonal) living thing (known). It has seen 5000 summers go by, many full moons and droughts and meteor showers. Fortunately, it can't think (like us), else (I imagine) it would have been unbearably boring to just stand in a Californian desert for millennia.
