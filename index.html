		<p>Welcome to my website!</p>

		<p>I am Shrivathsa Pandelu. Here's my <a href="/cv.html">CV</a>. I am a first year maths PhD student at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.</p>

		<h3><a href="./misc_links/now_archive.html">Now</a></h3>
		Spring semester 2023. Taking courses on Algebraic Geometry, Lie Groups and hopefully I will also be able to read a bunch of things on the side.

		<script type="text/javascript">
				canvas = document.getElementById('canvas')
				canvas.height = 25;
				canvas.width = document.getElementById('progress-bar').clientWidth;

				function days_between(date1, date2) {
					const one_day = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24;
					return (date2 - date1) / one_day;
				}

				var c = canvas.getContext('2d');//context
				c.fillStyle = "grey";
				c.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

					percentage = 1 - (days_between(today, end) / days_between(start, end));
				}
				c.fillStyle = "green";
				c.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width * percentage, canvas.height);

						On the left is a groundhog preparing its nest for hibernation. The northern hemisphere is warming up and a lot of bats, groundhogs and bears would be waking up from their long winter slumber. Interestingly, ectothermic creatures like reptiles and amphibians cannot hibernate but instead show some dormancy (brumation). Some birds exihibit (involuntarily) lowered activity (torpor). It's all triggered by seasonal cues and their biology. Would they too think to themselves "just 5 more minutes"?
