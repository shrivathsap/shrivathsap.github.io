		<p>Welcome to my website!</p>

		<p>I am Shrivathsa Pandelu. Here's my <a href="/cv.html">CV</a>. I am a first year maths PhD student at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.</p>

		<h3>Now</h3>
		Finished my preliminary exams. Taking courses on Harmonic analysis, Lie groups and Algebraic Geometry, while also reading things on my own. First Minnesotan winter.

		<h3>Picture of the month</h3>

					The front page of The Guardian from October 28 2022. "On the day that Shell reports another round of bumper profits, and UK temperatures hit 20C in October, the UN finds there is 'no credible way' to keep to the 1.5C climate target". Towards the bottom right it says that the Meta (parent company of Facebook) shares lost 25% value and the bottom row is about an interview with actor Bill Nighy and a ranking of Jennifer Lawrence's films.
