		<p>Welcome to my website!</p>

		<p>I am Shrivathsa Pandelu. Here's my <a href="/cv.html">CV</a>. I am a first year maths PhD student at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.</p>

		<h3>Now</h3>
		Finished my preliminary exams. Taking courses on Harmonic analysis, Lie groups and Algebraic Geometry, while also reading things on my own. First Minnesotan winter.

		<h3>About this site</h3>
		<p>This site is a pet project. It is hosted by GitHub, and was created using Jekyll. It currently uses a modified Jekyll Minima theme. The purpose of this site is to host some of the things I have written and perhaps the occasional maths related post or something like that.
