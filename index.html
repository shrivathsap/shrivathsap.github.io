						After last month's picture, I have to talk about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coyote">coyote</a>. The linked Wikipedia page contains a lot of interesting information and other pictures. Coyotes were originally only found in the southewest North America and Mexico. With the extermination of wolves, they have spread across America, all theway to Alaska. In native american folktales, the coyote is depicted as a trickster. Unlike the cartoons, however, coyotes in real life don't spend their time constructing elaborate traps to hunt roadrunners.</br>
