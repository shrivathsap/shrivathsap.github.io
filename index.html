						This is a picture of an elephant, specifically, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_bush_elephant">African bush elephant</a>. But what I really want to highlight is the elephant trunk. It is pure muscle, very little fat and no bones. There are more muscles in the elephant trunk than there are in the human body! It can lift up to 350kgs but can also crack a peanut shell without breaking the peanut. Using their trunk, elephants can reach for things up to 7m high and dig the ground!</br>
						
						It is awesome as a nose too - able to siphon water, useable as a snorkel when swimming and has an amazing sense of smell. An evolutionary marvel! Other things about the elephant that amuse me are their tusks, ears, ability to sense vibrations through their feet, their sheer size. What amazing creatures!
