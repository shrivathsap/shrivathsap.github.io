						This is a picture of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1054">Crab Nebula</a> taken by the Hubble telescope. This nebula formed when a star exploded and lit the skies for 2 years between 1054 and 1056. When a star's core is not supported against gravity pulling it inwards, it collapses at about 23% the speed of light. In other words, if you were standing there, the ground would disappear at a significant fraction of the speed of light! What follows is a lot of nuclear and astrophysics that I don't understand, leading to the creation of heavier elements (which is the only way things like iron even come into existence) and depending on the mass of the collapsing star, we may get a neutron star, a black hole, or some other exotic cosmic object. Incomprehensible sense of size, scale and energy!</br>
