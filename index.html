						This is the thumbnail on Youtube for one of my favourite pieces of music: <a href="https://youtu.be/M0MrgXqat5k">primeiro ver√£o</a> by Lilian Pinto. It means "first summer" in Portuguese and this has been a summer of many firsts for me and perhaps the world too. I got diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and it has been quite a horrible shock. This has also been my first summer as a proper adult with a job and responsibilities. This July there were so many many climate records broken that we're in for some drastic climate disasters that we have absolutely no control over. This was also a first monsoon with far fewer rains than I remember.
