						This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearded_vulture">bearded vulture</a>, also called an ossifrage. It's the only known vertebrate whose diet is mostly bones! Vultures are scavengers, but this particular creature has evolved to only feed on bones. If the bones are too big, they carry it up into the air and drop it and repeat the process until the bone breaks (ossi=bone, frage=break) - this is something they learn over the course of their life. Sometimes they attack live animals and seem to favour tortoises. Can you guess how they break a tortoise's shell? I can only wonder why it evolved this way.
