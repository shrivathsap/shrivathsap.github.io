		<p>Welcome to my website!</p>

		<p>I am Shrivathsa Pandelu. Here's my <a href="/cv.html">CV</a>. I am a first year maths PhD student at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.</p>

		<h3><a href="./misc_links/now_archive.html">Now</a></h3>
		Spring semester 2023. Taking courses on Algebraic Geometry, Lie Groups and hopefully I will also be able to read a bunch of things on the side.
		<div id="progress-bar" style="width:100%;">
			<canvas id="canvas" title="Countdown to go home"></canvas>
		</div>
		<script type="text/javascript">
				canvas = document.getElementById('canvas')
				canvas.height = 25;
				canvas.width = document.getElementById('progress-bar').clientWidth;

				function days_between(date1, date2) {
					const one_day = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24;
					return (date2 - date1) / one_day;
				}

				var c = canvas.getContext('2d');//context
				c.fillStyle = "grey";
				c.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
				start = new Date(2023, 0, 14);
				end = new Date(2023, 4, 15);
				today = new Date();
				//today.setHours(0, 0, 0);
				percentage = 1;
				if (days_between(today, end) >= 0) {
					percentage = 1 - (days_between(today, end) / days_between(start, end));
				}
				c.fillStyle = "green";
				c.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width * percentage, canvas.height);

						On the left is an illustration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleen"> baleen</a> hair. The baleen plate is a clever mechanism that enables whales to take in a lot of water and filter it out through this comb-like structure leaving behind small creatures like krill (which the whales eat). I think it's pretty cool. There's an animation in the movie "Finding Nemo" by Pixar Studios. There's this song called "Baleen Morning" by Balmorhea that led me to look up the word.
