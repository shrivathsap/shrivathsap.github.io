						"Picture of the month" is now 3 years old. How time flies! This is a picture of a <href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_bubbler_crab">sand bubbler crab</href> next to the many little balls of sand that it makes as it filters and eats plankton and other organic matter. They live in burrows within a ball of air while the tide is high, and when the tide goes out they come out to feed. The tide comes back in and breaks away the little sand balls. Such is the life of a sand bubbler crab. The tide comes in and washes away its work...but it is the tide that brings in food too. So it goes.
