						This is a picture of Saturn's moon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daphnis_(moon)">Daphnis</a>. It's about 8km in diameter and resides in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn#Keeler_Gap">Keeler gap</a>, a 42km wide gap in Saturn's A-ring. This moon was discovered in 2005, but it was inferred to exist before that because of its gravitational effects on the rings. As visible in this picture, as the moon orbits Saturn it pulls and tugs on the rings and this causes these ripples on the edges of the Keeler gap. Why ripples? Because the inner ring moves slightly faster than the moon and the outer one slightly slower - so the inner ripple moves ahead of the moon and the outer one lags behind. This is such a beautiful phenomenon in our solar system!
