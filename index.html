						This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoat">stoat</a> in its winter fur. It looks fluffy and cute. Stoat's belong to the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustelidae">family</a> as otters and weasels and such. Stoats are distributed across the Northern hemisphere and this white fur is seen in those subspecies that live further up North. There are 21 subspecies and they moult twice a year (the moulting process initiated by change in day length) and some of them go completely white (except for the ends of their tails) during the winter.

						These creatures are carnivorous and when introduced in New Zealand to control rabbits, they quickly became one of the "top 100" worse invasive species! Interestingly, the stoat doesn't dig its own burrow, but uses the burrows of its prey. Sadly, their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ermine_(heraldry)">white fur</a> used to be seen as a status of royalty.
