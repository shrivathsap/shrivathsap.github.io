						Another year has passed and "Picture of the month" has turned 2. The Northern hemisphere is cooling and the leaves are changing colours. I wonder if the trees know how beautiful they look, but alas, beauty is in the eye of the beholder...or so it goes.</br>

						This year's winter has been particularly warm, partly due to climate change, and partly due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023%E2%80%932024_El_Ni%C3%B1o_event">El Nino event</a>. In fact, this year has been so warm that for the first time in 130 years, Mount Fuji (the mountain in the picture) is <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2dp1l8wklo">without snow in November</a>.</br>
