						Time flies, huh. Well, February is the shortest month, even with a leap day. Did you know that you can know the age of some trees by counting the tree rings (you don't have to cut the tree, you can drill out a sample)? It's because as the tree grows, the type of bark it makes changes depending on the seasons. So you get an alternating pattern and counting those gives you how many years have passed. Of course, it's also because there's only one of each season every year (or is it the other way round?). It's not accurate, of course, because the same season can have different severity over the years. What you're actually looking at is the climate history that the tree has lived through! This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrochronology">dendrochronology</a>.
