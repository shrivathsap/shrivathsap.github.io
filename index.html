		<p>Welcome to my website!</p>

		<p>I am Shrivathsa Pandelu, currently an MMath second year student at ISI Kolkata. Before that I got my BMath degree from ISI Bangalore. Here's my <a href="/cv.html">CV</a>.</p>

		<h3> Now </h3>

		<p>Final semester of MMath, taking the following courses: Advanced Number Theory, Algebraic Topology, Elliptic Curves, Commutative Algebra, Algebraic Geometry. Semester ends on 8th June.</p>

		<h3>About this site</h3>
		<p>This site is a pet project. It is hosted by GitHub, and was created using Jekyll. It currently uses a modified Jekyll Minima theme. The purpose of this site is to host some of the things I have written and perhaps the occasional maths related post or something like that. Please enable JavaScript, and update your browser regularly.</p>
