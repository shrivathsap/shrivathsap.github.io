						The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot">Pale Blue Dot</a> has gone around the sun yet again since I started "Picture of the month". Much has happened and this is a reminder that time's precious. To sieze the day while we are still able to is the hope that drives us. Some days we are able to sieze while others slip through the fingers like dry sand on a deserted beach; deserted, yet the susurration of waves is incessant.<br />
						On the left is Earth as seen from 6 billion kilometres away: it's the pale dot about half way up the rightmost band.<br />
