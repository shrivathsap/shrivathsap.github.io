						This is a picture of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_tern">Arctic tern</a> hovering over its nest with some food in its mouth. Arctic terns are most famous for their migration - on average they fly 48,700-70,900km, annually! Every year, they enjoy two summers (it is freezing here in MN, brrr).
						</br>
						They mostly live on fish, crabs and the like. They mate for life and return to the same colony each year, and both sexes share incubation duties. During the southern summer (i.e., right now) they can be seen as far south as the edges of Antarctica. They can live up to 30 years, which means they might travel 2.4 million kms - equivalent to flying to the moon and back more than three times!! There are many more things I want to say, but alas this space is too short. Along with the linked Wikipedia page, check out <a href="https://www.akwildlife.org/news/species-spotlight-arctic-tern">this article.</a>
