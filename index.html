		<p>Welcome to my website!</p>

		<p>I am Shrivathsa Pandelu. Here's my <a href="/cv.html">CV</a>. I am a first year maths PhD student at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.</p>

		<h3><a href="./misc_links/now_archive.html">Now</a></h3>
		Spring semester 2023. Taking courses on Algebraic Geometry, Lie Groups and hopefully I will also be able to read a bunch of things on the side.

						This month I'd like to bring attention to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigfin_squid">Bigfin squid</a> and more generally, deep sea creatures. This (genus of) species on the left is so rare that we only have a handful of sightings and we aren't even sure about it's full size (it's tentacles are believed to grow up to 8m in length) as an adult nor do we know about its feeding habits or how it eats even! It's really fascinating how these creatures have evolved at such depths and darkness and how little we know about them. In a way, the depths of the ocean is an alien world compared to the surface.
