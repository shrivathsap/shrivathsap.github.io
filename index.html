						This is a picture of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labord's_chameleon">Labord's chameleon</a>. Amazingly, in certain arid regions of their habitat, these species have a lifespan of about 4-5 months: the eggs hatch during the wet season in November, they reach adulthood by January, then they deposit their eggs between late January and late March after which the entire species dies. Poof, just like that, and the cycle continues.
						</br>
						That's just evolution and this strategy seems to have worked for this species at this point in history.
