<title> About </title>
Welcome to my website!

I am Shrivathsa Pandelu, currently an MMath second year student at ISI Kolkata. In the mathematical sphere, I am mostly interested in the corner occupied by Geometry and Topology, however other corners are interesting too. It feels really weird to talk about oneself in this manner. Here's my [CV](./cv.html).

This site is hosted by GitHub, and was created using Jekyll. It currently uses (a modified) Jekyll Minima theme.
