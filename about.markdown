I am currently an MMath second year student at ISI Kolkata. I am primarily interested in Geometry and topology, although I do find other branches of mathematics interesting. It feels really weird to talk about oneself in this manner. Here's my [cv](https://www.youtube.com).

This site is hosted by GitHub, and was created using Jekyll. It currently uses the Jekyll minima theme and I intend to change it someday.
